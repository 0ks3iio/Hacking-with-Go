# Basics
This is a quick introduction to Go. This section assumes you know other programming languages (most likely Python) and are familiar with basic programming structures.

These notes were originally created during the tutorials at [Tour of Go][tour-of-go] and some other sources. Then more were added to make it a reference/cheat sheet.

## Packages
Go is divided into packages. Packages are the equivalent of modules in Python. Only the `main` package can be executed with `go run`.

We can import packages with `import`. The Hello World application imported the `fmt` package. Multiple imports are similar:

``` go
import (
    "fmt"
    "math/rand"
    "otherimport"
)
```

### Exported names
In Go, a name is exported if it begins with a capital letter.

When importing a package, you can refer only to its exported names. Unexported names are not accessible from outside the package.

## Functions
Unlike C, type comes after variable name except for pointers.

``` go
// 02-01-multiply.go
package main

import "fmt"

func multiply(x int, y int) int {
    return x * y
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(multiply(10,20))
}
```

### Functions can return multiple values
A function can return any number of values. Gone are the days when we had to use pointers in function parameters as extra return values.

``` go
// 02-02-addTwo.go
package main

import "fmt"

func addTwo(x int, y int) (int, int) {
    return x+2, y+2
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(addTwo(10,20))
}
```

If multiple variables have the same type we can declare them like this:

``` go
func addTwo(x, y int) (int, int) {
    return x+2, y+2
}
```

### Named return values
Return values can be named. If so, they are treated as variables defined in the function.

A return statement without arguments returns the named return values. This is known as a "naked" return. _Using named return values and naked return is frowned upon unless it helps readability._

``` go
// 02-03-addTwo2.go
package main

import "fmt"

func addTwo2(x int, y int) (xPlusTwo int, yPlusTwo int) {
    xPlusTwo = x + 2
    yPlusTwo = y + 2

    return xPlusTwo, yPlusTwo
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(addTwo2(20,30))
}
```

## Variables
Use `var`.

- `var x int`

Can be combined for multiple variables:

- `var x,y int` == `var x int, y int`

### Initialization
Variables can be initialized.

- `var a, b int = 10, 20`

or

- `var a int = 10`
- `var b int = 20`

If initialized value is present during declaration, type can be omitted:

- `var sampleInt, sampleBoolean, sampleString = 30, true, "Hello"`

or

- `var sampleInt = 30`
- `var sampleBoolean = true`
- `var sampleString = "Hello"`

``` go
// 02-04-variables.go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    var a, b int = 10, 20
    var sampleInt, sampleBoolean, sampleString = 30, true, "Hello"

    fmt.Println(a, b , sampleInt, sampleBoolean, sampleString)
}
```
### Initialization Values
If no initial value is assigned to a declared variable, it will get a `zero` value:

- `0` for numeric types (int, float, etc.).
- `false` for the boolean type.
- `""` (the empty string) for strings.

### Short variable declarations
Inside a function (including `main`), the `:=` short assignment statement can be used in place of a `var` declaration with implicit type.

Outside a function, every statement begins with a keyword (`var`, `func`) so the `:=` construct is not available.

``` go
// 02-05-short-declaration.go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    sampleInt, sampleBoolean, sampleString := 30, true, "Hello"

    fmt.Println(sampleInt, sampleBoolean, sampleString)
}
```

`var` statements can be put in different lines (increases readability):

``` go
var (
    sampleInt           = 30
    sampleBoolean       = true
    sampleString        = "Hello"
)
```

Several other Go constructs use the same format. For example `import` and `const`.

## Basic types

``` go
bool

string

int  int8  int16  int32  int64  // use int unless you want a specific size
uint uint8 uint16 uint32 uint64 uintptr // ditto, use uint

byte // alias for uint8

rune // alias for int32
     // represents a Unicode char

float32 float64

complex64 complex128
```

## Casting
Casting needs to be explicit, unlike C where some castings worked out of the box.

``` go
// 02-06-casting.go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    var a, b int = 20, 30
    // Need to convert a and b to float32 before the division
    var div float32 = float32(a) / float32(b)
    // Cast float32 to int
    var divInt = int(div)
    fmt.Println(div, divInt)
}
```

## Constants
Declared with `const` keyword. Can be character, string, boolean or numeric. Cannot use `:=`. Coding standard requires constants to start with a capital letter.

``` go
// 02-07-const.go
package main

import "fmt"

const Whatever = "whatever"

func main() {
    fmt.Println(Whatever)

    const One = 1
    fmt.Println(One)
}
```

## For
Similar to C with two differences:

- No parenthesis around the three components. Having parenthesis will give result in an error.
- Curly braces `{ }` are always required and the first one needs to be in the same line as for, if, etc.

It has three components:

- `for init; condition; post { }`

``` go
// 02-08-for1.go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // var sum int
    sum := 0
    for i := 0; i < 20; i++ {
        sum += i
    }

    fmt.Println(sum)
}
```

Init and post (first and last) components are optional and turn `for` into `while`:

``` go
// 02-08-for2.go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // var sum int
    sum, i := 0
    for i < 20 { // while (i<20)
        sum += i
        i++
    }

    fmt.Println(sum)
}
```

Without the condition it turns into `for(;;)` or `while(1)`

``` go
for {   // while(1)
    ...
}
```

## ++ and --
Don't be fooled by their use in `for` examples. According to the [FAQ][faq-incdec], they are "statements" and not "expressions." In other words we can use them to increase or decrease a variable by one but cannot assign the result to a different one.

This will not work:

``` go
// 02-09-incdec.go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // var sum int
    sum, i := 0
    // This will not work
    sum = i++
    fmt.Println(sum)
}
```

```
Z:\Go\src\Hacking-with-Go\code\02>go run 02-09-incdec.go
# command-line-arguments
.\02-09-incdec.go:9:9: syntax error: unexpected ++ at end of statement
```

## if
Does not need parenthesis but needs curly braces.


``` go
// 02-10-if1.go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {

    a := 10
    b := 20

    if b > a {
        fmt.Println(b, ">", a)
    }
}
```

## Short statements
Short statements are interesting. They are statements that are executed before the condition. It's not a unique idea to Go because we have already seen them in `for` constructs in almost every language.

They can be used in `if`s.

``` go
// 02-11-if2.go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {

    if var1 := 20; var1 > 10 {
        fmt.Println("Inside if:", var1)
    }
    // Cannot use the variable var1 here
}
```

In this code `var1 := 20` is executed before the `if` condition. Any variables declared in the short statement are only in scope in the `if` block and are destroyed after.

Short statements are usually used for executing a function and checking the return value with an `if`.

## else
`else` is similar to C else.

If the corresponding `if` has a short statement then any variables declared in the short statement are also in scope in the `else` block.


``` go
// 02-12-else.go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {

    if var1 := 20; var1 > 100 {
        fmt.Println("Inside if:", var1)
    } else {
        // Can use var1 here
        fmt.Println("Inside else:", var1)
    }
    // Cannot use var1 here
}
```

## switch
Similar to C switch with some differences:

- Doesn't automatically go to the next `switch` statement unless you have `fallthrough` in the end. The `fallthrough` only works if it's the last statement in the case.
- Can have a short statement like `if`.

``` go
// 02-13-switch.go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "math/rand" // This is not cryptographically secure!
    "time"
)

func main() {
    // Seeding rand
    rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())
    fmt.Println("Choosing a random number:")

    switch num := rand.Intn(3); num {
    case 1:
        fmt.Println("1")
    case 2:
        fmt.Println("2")
    default:
        fmt.Println("3")
    }
}
```

Cases can have `if` conditions if we use a switch with an empty value:

``` go
// 02-14-switch2.go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "math/rand" // This is not cryptographically secure!
    "time"
)

func main() {
    // Seeding rand
    rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())
    fmt.Println("Choosing a random number:")

    switch num := rand.Intn(100); {
    case num < 50:
        fmt.Println("Less than 50")
    default:
        fmt.Println("More than 50")
    }
}
```

The short statement does not have to be part of the switch:


``` go
// 02-15-switch3.go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "math/rand" // This is not cryptographically secure!
    "time"
)

func main() {
    // Seeding rand
    rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())
    fmt.Println("Choosing a random number:")

    num := rand.Intn(100)
    switch {
    case num < 50:
        fmt.Println("Less than 50")
    default:
        fmt.Println("More than 50")
    }
}
```

## defer
`defer` is another interesting feature in Go. It defers the execution of a function until the calling function returns.

It works like a stack, every time program reaches a `defer`, it will push that function with its argument values. When surrounding function returns, deferred functions are popped from the stack and executed.

``` go
// 02-16-defer1.go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    defer fmt.Println("This runs after main")

    fmt.Println("Main ended")
}
```

Results in:

```
Z:\Go\src\Hacking-with-Go\code\02>go run 02-16-defer1.go
Main ended
This runs after main
```

Argument values are saved when the `defer` statement is reached but it is executed later.

``` go
// 02-17-defer2.go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    num := 1
    defer fmt.Println("After main returns", num)

    num++
    fmt.Println("Inside main", num)
}
```

The value of `num` was `1` when the print was deferred.

## Pointers
Similar to C:

- Point with `*`: `var p *int` == `int *p;`
- Generate pointer (get address of) with `&`: `i := 1` and `p = &i`

**No pointer arithmetic.**

## Structs
Go does not have classes. It has structs like C.

Exported field names need to be uppercase to be visible outside the defining package.

``` go
// 02-18-structs.go
package main

import "fmt"

type Student struct {
    FirstName string
    LastName  string
}

func main() {
    // Make an instance
    studentOne := Student{"Ender", "Wiggin"}

    // Now we can access fields
    fmt.Println(studentOne.FirstName)

    // We can just assign fields using names, anything not assigned will be
    // initialized with "zero" as we have seen before
    studentTwo := Student{FirstName: "Petra"}

    // We will print "{Petra }" notice the space after Petra which is supposed
    // to be the delimiter between the fields, LastName is nil because it is not
    // given a value
    fmt.Println(studentTwo)

    // Can also make a pointer to a struct
    p := &studentOne

    // Now instead of *p.LastName (doesn't work) we can just use p.LastName
    // fmt.Println((*p).LastName) will not work with error message: invalid indirect of p (type Student)
    fmt.Println(p.LastName)

    // Which is the same as
    fmt.Println(studentOne.LastName)

    // We can just create a pointer out of the blue
    p2 := &Student{"Hercule", "Poirot"}
    fmt.Println(p2)
}
```

Tour of Go says, we have to create a pointer to a struct to access fields while we can just do it directly as we saw in the code.

## Arrays

`var a [10]int` == `int a[10];`.

**Arrays cannot be resized.**

``` go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    var a [5]int
    a[0] = 10
    a[4] = 20
    fmt.Println(a)

    // We can initialize arrays during creation
    // str[3] is empty
    str := [3]string{"Ronny", "Johnson"}

    fmt.Println(str)
}
```

## Slices
Slice is a dynamic view of an array. Slices _don't store anything_ by themselves, they reference an array. If we change something via the slice, the array is modified.

For our usecases, slices are dynamic arrays. When a slice is created out of the blue, an underlying array is also initialized and can be modified by the slice.

``` go
// 02-19-slice1.go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {

    // Create an array of strings with 3 members
    characters := [3]string{"Ender", "Petra", "Mazer"}

    // Last index is exclusive
    // allMembers []string := characters[0:3]
    var allMembers []string = characters[0:3]
    fmt.Println("All members", allMembers)

    var lastTwo []string = characters[1:3]
    fmt.Println("Last two members", lastTwo)

    // Replace Mazer with Bean
    fmt.Println("Replacing Mazer with Bean")
    allMembers[2] = "Bean"

    fmt.Println("All members after Bean swap", characters)

    fmt.Println("Last two members after Bean swap", lastTwo)
}
```
