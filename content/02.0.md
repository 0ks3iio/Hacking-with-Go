# 02 - Basics
This is a quick introduction to Go. This section assumes you know other programming languages (most likely Python) and are familiar with basic programming structures.

These notes were originally created during the tutorials at [Tour of Go][tour-of-go] and some other sources. Then more were added to make it a reference/cheat sheet.
