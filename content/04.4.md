# 04.3 - SSH client and server
Next in line is creating SSH clients and servers. The [/x/crypto/ssh][ssh-pkg] provides SSH connectivity. It's not one of the standard libraries so you need to `go get golang.org/x/crypto/ssh` before use. The package documentation have some examples that we can reuse.

We can authenticate to the server using either user/pass or certificate.
