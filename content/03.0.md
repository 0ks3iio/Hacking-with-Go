# 03 - Useful Go packages
This is where this repo is going to divert a bit from BH books. This section is going to be simple guides to Go packages that will be used later. For example the `flag` package is used to create and process command line parameters and is a building block of almost every security script that hopes to be re-used. Some packages like `net` are more complex and better learned in action while building/using tools.

As I move forward and learn more, I will return and add more tutorials here.
