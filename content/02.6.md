# 02.6 - Goroutines, channels and more

With that said, let's look at one of Go's main selling points, the `goroutine`. `go function(a, b)` runs the function in parallel and continues with the rest of the program. Almost every parallel tutorial uses a variation of a parallel counting example:

``` go
// 02.6-01-goroutine1.go
package main

import "fmt"

func Count(limit int) {
    for i := 0; i < limit; i++ {
        fmt.Printf("Counting: %d\n", i) // Now we know Printf
    }
}

func main() {

    go Count(100)
    go Count(100)

    fmt.Println("Main finished!")
}
```

But we never see anything counted because `main` returns before `Count`s are spun up and start printing:

```
$ go run 02.6-01-goroutine1.go
Main finished!
```

Lesson learned: **Always wait for Goroutines to finish! (if applicable).**

Continuing the C tradition, we can wait for a key-press before ending `main`.

``` go
code
```
